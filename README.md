* Personal: For individual users, ArthroBot becomes a reliable assistant, whether at home or in the office. It excels in completing repetitive pre-programmed tasks or more complex operations when combined with computer vision and sensor fusion technologies.
* Industrial: In industrial settings, ArthroBot shines in diverse applications including photography, cinematography, security, defense, and food processing. It performs a wide range of programmed or intelligent tasks such as anti-theft surveillance, video recording, tracking, and surveillance, as well as combat support operations.

### Technical Specification
### Software Stack
ArthroBot relies on a robust software stack comprising ROS2 Humble and MoveIt2, along with other complementary software packages. This integrated software ecosystem enables seamless kinematic and motion computations, teleoperation, and simulation. Notably, ArthroBot includes a digital twin within its software suite, allowing developers to simulate the robotic arm for testing and refinement without the need for the physical hardware, thereby expediting development and testing phases.

### Hardware Components
ArthroBot is driven by an Arduino UNO R3 microcontroller for precise control. The selection of this microcontroller is based on its widespread popularity and accessibility, coupled with the simplicity of its programming, which streamlines integration and accelerates control system development. The microcontroller orchestrates the motion of five servo motors, controlling both the arm and the end effector. The end effector itself, resembling a pen, offers adaptability for different gripper configurations to suit various application needs.
